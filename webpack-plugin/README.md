# Webpack plugin creation

The minimalist project example includes a Webpack configuration with two entrypoints.

It is a small extract of the original project [chunks-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/yoriiis/chunks-webpack-plugin).

## Available npm scripts

* `npm start`
* `npm build`
* `npm inspect`

## Demo steps

* Run `npm start`
* Check build files
* Add breakpoints into the plugin
* Run `npm run inspect`
* Run VS Code debug _Node: Nodemon
* Rerun `npm run inspect`
* Manipulate the VS Code inspector
* Open the Chrome inspector
* Play with `compiler` and `compilation` objects
